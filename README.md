### FE 2013 Paired Project
## Romcom

# Project Overview
For our first paird project in the Mod 1 Front End program, we were tasked with building the Javascript component of a website that already had implemented HTML and CSS. The goal was to understand the intersectionality of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the DOM. We created functionality on the webpage by using our knowledge querying in JavaScript, creating event listeners, and event handlers. Our goals were to write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data, use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword, and manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM.

# How To
When you enter our page, the first thing that you will see is a randomly generated romance novel cover, along with a randomly generated title, and a randomly generated tagline. 

![Front Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49215782/114216674-74a86f00-9924-11eb-8c37-66b456a75aed.png)

You will also notice a navigation bar at the top of the page with the below buttons:

![Buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49215782/114218437-a1f61c80-9926-11eb-921f-5ba7cfa07abe.png)

If you click, "Show New Random Cover" - you will find that a new cover, with a randomly chosen image, title, and tagline appears on the main page
If you happen to like the cover you see, you can click "Save Cover". And if you would like to view all of the covers you have saved - you can click "View Saved Covers".
Below is an example of a user's covers they have decided to save

![Saved Covers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49215782/114216799-9dc8ff80-9924-11eb-9534-f69c89a65e5a.png)

The last button, "Make Your Own Cover", will reveal four input fields where you can type the URL of an image you would like to see on a cover, a custom title, and two custom descriptors. Pressing the "Make my Book" button below these fields will display your new cover on the main page. At the same time, this button will also add the data you added to the original list, meaning your information has an opportunity to show up randomly as well. Feel free to save this cover to your "Saved Covers"!
