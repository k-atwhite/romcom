[Our Project](https://k-atwhite.github.io/romcom/)

# Technologies Used
To complete the project, we used Mac's native terminal, atom text editor, a wonderful
atom extension that allowed us to type in each other's atom remotely -
called [teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/), and github to track our changes
and also to display our webpage. Our webpage is built with CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

# How To
People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well… maybe that’s true.
We’re going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!

When you enter our page, the first thing that you will see is a randomly generated
romance novel cover, along with a randomly generated title, and a randomly generated tagline.

The top of the page gives you four options to play around with the romance novel data
that we have stored, and will even allow you to add your own data!

The first button, reading from the left is "Show New Random Cover". Pressing this button will
generate yet another random cover, title, and descriptor, right on the home screen.

If you like this cover,  you can click the second button "Save Cover". This will add
the cover you like to your saved covers page. You can view all these saved covers by pressing
the third button "View Saved Covers".

Finally, the fourth button "Make Your Own Cover" will reveal four input fields where you
can type the URL of an image you would like to see on a cover, a custom title, and two custom descriptors.
Pressing the "Make my Book" button below these fields will display your new cover on the main page. At the same time,
this button will also add the data you added to the original list, meaning your information has an opportunity
to show up randomly as well.
